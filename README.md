This application is the test task for "ITRANSITION" company.

Application represents a command-line interface for data import from CSV table to MySQL database table.

Application provides an opportunity to test import from CSV without insertion data into database
(use --test option in command line for this).

ATTENTION!

- columns delimiter in CSV-file MUST be "," (comma)
- If Discontinued is pointed in CSV-file as supported for the Product, Discontinued date in database table sets to current date

Application does NOT import from CSV:
 - records with products, which costs less than 5 currency units and quantity of them is less than 10
 - records with products, which costs more than 1000 currency units
 - records with string columns, which contain "," and are not in quotes
   
Application imports WRONGLY from CSV
 - records with float or int columns, which contain non-numeric data. They might be set to 0 in the database table
